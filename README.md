# SoftwareDesignDocGameClient
A software design document created for a client (The Gaming Room) for an app called 'Draw It OR Lose It'

Breakdown:
A new client called The Gaming Room wanted to take their existing Android only game product 'Draw It OR Lose It' and make a web-based game that is supported by multiple different platforms.
What stands out to me in my design document that was done particularly well was the breakdown of requirements and the pros/cons that they have. As well as the recommendation section I think it encapsulates the proper route to go given the constraints put down by the client.
The domain model was helpful for the development of the code. It provided clarification to the structure so there was no ambiguity there. 
If I could revise one part of the document in retrospect I would do the 'Design Constraint' section and specifically nail down their target audience beyond just any platform.   
When deciding what the core user's needs are I reviewed what the core elements of the game-play would be. Once I had those they played a significant role in deciding architecture as they have to be able to review images in real time with low latency. This is important because the user is the client's target audience and if they are not able to fulfill their needs to a satisfactory standard then the project is pointless.
While designing the software I followed the design document and requirements set out by the client. I kept in mind the image retrieval and player architecture, simultaneous games, and authorization.
